MobileDevelopmentApp -  a final assignment created for a college course in collaboration with a classmate. The main code can be found in Portfolio/Apps and Programs/MobileDevelopmentApp/main/java/com/example/finalproject/ which was written mainly in jave. The app allows a user to take a picture of an item in their fridge, record information about it such as its name, expiration date, quantity, in order to organize information about them.
