A collection of code I created on various projects through college

Information for my Capstone, JuniorYearGame, and SophmoreYearGame can all be found within those respective folders.

The website I made for my Web Systems class consisted of a database, user login, css, and bootstrap, and was written in
javascript, php, sql, and html.

My Mobile Development App was an app to organize info about items in your firdge.
You can take a picture of food and enter in its expiration date and when you bought it.
The app will then organize food by type and which food expires the soonest.
This app was written in Android Studio and utilized xml coding.
